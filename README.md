# Frail Weaponry Source Code
All scripts are located in Game/Projects/Assets/Scripts/

This game was made in 4 days by Mike Evans (Programming) and Fraser (Art/Design), with the use of a soundtrack by Elliot Rowlands.

Fraser wrote one or two of the scripts in the game, just look out for the long if else statements and switch statements, and the methods titled "Example" haha
