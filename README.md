# Frail Weaponry Source Code
All scripts are located in Game/Projects/Assets/Scripts/

This game was made in 4 days by Mike Evans (Programming) and Fraser (Art/Design), with the use of a soundtrack by Elliot Rowlands.

We are currently developing an update for the game to improve on some features, fix some bugs and add a bit more polish. Stay tuned! :)

Fraser wrote one or two of the scripts in the game, just look out for the long if else statements and switch statements, and the methods titled "Example" haha
